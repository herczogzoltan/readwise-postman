# Readwise Postman

The [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection for [readwise.io](https://readwise.io) API endpoints.


## Install

There is no need to install anything, we are using only the built-in functions of Postman. This repository contains 2 things:

- An [environment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) for Postman.
- A [postman collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/)

**Import the environment**

1. [Open the environment](https://github.com/herczogzoltan/readwise-postman/blob/main/Readwise.postman_environment.json) file and copy it's content
2. In Postman, go to **File > Import > Raw text**
3. Paste the raw json, hit **Continue** and **Import**

**Import the collection**

1. [Open the collection](https://github.com/herczogzoltan/readwise-postman/blob/main/Readwise.postman_collection.json) file and copy it's content
2. In Postman, go to **File > Import > Raw text**
3. Paste the raw json, hit **Continue** and **Import**

If you have any trouble while importing, here you can find an [extended documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/)
